# Processor-LegV8
Created for my Computer Architecture Class

Used LegV8 assembly code

Input a file and break down the instructions into R, I, D, C, CB instructions with the correct oopcode, address, etc.

Would trasnlate SUB X21, X23, X24 into the correct binary

Then it would start the PC (program counter) and do the instructions
